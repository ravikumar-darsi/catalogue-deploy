Generally, how we do deployment ?

1. Create a server
2. Provision the server using Ansible
3. Stop the server
4. Take AMI
5. Create launch template version
6. Refresh auto-scaling

To deploy catalogue, you should create the infra upto 05-app-alb
and catalogue will be deployed using Jenkins

Until now we have ansible is downloading the packages from S3 and but now onwards
download artifacts from nexus and we can even download a particular version....

Ansible have to know about the 
Nexus location and then artifact version 

to achieve this we should make some changes in the playbook 

from terraform you should send the artifact version to ansible
